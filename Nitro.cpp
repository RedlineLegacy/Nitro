     Extended information:
     Redline is an Universal Binary, meaning it contains code for PPC and Intel.
     Needless to say that Mavericks doesn't support PPC. That means we can
     remove the PPC code from the executable, which reduces the file size from
     5MB to ~1MB. That's also nice for patching purposes. `lipo` strips the i386
     (Intel) code out of the old binary.
